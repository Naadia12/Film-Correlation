# Film Correlation # 

## Aim ##
- The primary aim of this project is to analyse the relationship between the budget and gross earnings of films.
-Identify key correlations between various movie features such as genre, runtime, release year, and ratings.
-Generate meaningful insights through data exploration, cleaning, and analysis, using Python to produce visual representations of these relationships

##Key steps##
Research and download a relevant movie dataset, which includes features like budget, gross earnings, runtime, and genre.
Environment Setup
Download and install a Python IDE such as Jupyter Notebook.
Set up Python libraries necessary for data analysis.
Load the dataset into the environment using Pandas.
Perform an initial exploration of the data, identifying key variables of interest.
Check for missing or inconsistent data and clean the dataset accordingly.
Compute the correlation matrix to examine relationships between various features, with a particular focus on budget and gross earnings.
Generate visual representations of the correlations using libraries.
Analyse and interpret the visualised correlations to draw insights on how different movie features relate to financial success.
Document these insights clearly.

##Challenges##
Some Python libraries were incompatible and there were many errors when importing or using certain functions. This required troubleshooting which was done by updating the libraries.
There were also instances where the code ran without errors but there was no output, such as graphs not displaying properly or calculations being incorrect. This meant a lot of code had to be debugged the code.
